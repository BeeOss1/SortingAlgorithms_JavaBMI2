# Sorting Algorithms in Java

Welcome to the SortingAlgorithms_Java repository! This repository contains Java implementations of various sorting algorithms.

## Overview

This repository aims to provide clear and efficient implementations of commonly used sorting algorithms in Java. Sorting algorithms are essential components of computer science and software engineering, and understanding them is crucial for writing efficient and optimized code.

## Included Sorting Algorithms

The following sorting algorithms are currently implemented in this repository:

1. **Bubble Sort**: A simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.
2. **Selection Sort**: An in-place comparison sorting algorithm that divides the input list into two parts: a sorted sublist and an unsorted sublist.
3. **Insertion Sort**: Another simple sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted array one item at a time by repeatedly picking the next element and inserting it into the sorted part of the array.
4. **Merge Sort**: A divide-and-conquer algorithm that divides the input array into two halves, recursively sorts the subarrays, and then merges them to produce the final sorted array.
5. **Quick Sort**: A highly efficient sorting algorithm that partitions the array into smaller parts, sorts the parts independently, and then combines them.

## Usage

Each sorting algorithm is implemented in its own Java class file within the repository. To use these sorting algorithms in your Java projects, you can simply copy the relevant Java files and integrate them into your codebase.

Here's a brief overview of how to use the sorting algorithms:

1. **Bubble Sort**: Instantiate the `BubbleSort` class and call the `sort()` method, passing the array to be sorted as an argument.
2. **Selection Sort**: Instantiate the `SelectionSort` class and call the `sort()` method, passing the array to be sorted as an argument.
3. **Insertion Sort**: Instantiate the `InsertionSort` class and call the `sort()` method, passing the array to be sorted as an argument.
4. **Merge Sort**: Instantiate the `MergeSort` class and call the `sort()` method, passing the array to be sorted as an argument.
5. **Quick Sort**: Instantiate the `QuickSort` class and call the `sort()` method, passing the array to be sorted as an argument.
